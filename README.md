# portfolio_template
This repository contains the code and assets for my personal portfolio website. It showcases my projects, skills, and experiences. The website is built using [technology used, e.g., HTML, CSS, Bootstrap etc.], and it's hosted using GitHub Pages. Feel free to explore the code or visit the live site at:(https://smruti030.github.io/portfolio_template/).

You can replace example images like VR.jpg and nature.jpg with your own profile pictures.
If you're using Bootstrap, you have two options:
      Offline: Link to the Bootstrap file youâ€™ve downloaded locally.
      Online: Use the CDN by copying the CDN link from the Bootstrap website.
